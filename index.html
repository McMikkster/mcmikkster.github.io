                <h2>Welcome to my blog!</h2><br>
                    <p>
                    Hey guys! My name is Ahmed Mikky and welcome to my food blog! This is my blog where I want to share all my favorite recipes and kitchen tips with you all. If I’m not posting here, I’m probably experimenting with different recipes.</p><br>

                    <p>
                    I’m currently a student at Bloomfield College double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I started cooking around 2018 and have learned a lot of tricks and amazing recipes that I want to share with you all. I’ve been planning for the longest time to create my own platform where I share my recipes, but I was always afraid of what other people would think. This is currently my Web Programming Project, I plan to keep this open for the future.

                    I want to share a couple facts about myself so you guys get to know me. I was born in the states, but my parents were both born in Palestine. My plans for the future are to get my degree and keep this site open for years to come. My favorite comfort food is mac and cheese. I love trying new recipes and using different types of cheeses.
