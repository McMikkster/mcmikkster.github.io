                A knife is the most essential part of any kitchen. Think of it like an extended part of your arm. A good knife can make the process of cooking all the better. There’s nothing worse in the kitchen than using a rusted, dull knife.

                <p>
                Purchasing a knife can be very confusing the first time you go shopping. You see all these ranges of prices that vary from $10 to around $500. You might go ahead and buy the cheaper one to save some money, but that is not the way to go about it. At the same time, don’t go blindly into purchasing a really expensive knife.

                The common knives you see are most likely German knives or western knives. These knives allow for more control and a comfy grip. They are also somewhat heavy and are quite durable. On the other hand, Japanese knives look similar to western knives, but the blades are much thinner. The harder steel and sharper edges allow for more precise cutting.

                A dull knife can make cooking very stressful. This makes it difficult to cut vegetables and meat precisely. You can even harm yourself because the knife could slip and cut your hand. A sharp knife makes cutting food very smooth and enjoyable.

                At the microscopic level, a knife looks like a narrow saw. The more you use it, the more the knife gets chipped and starts bending at the microscopic level.

                The best way to ruin your knives is to put them in the dishwasher. This can cause the knife to rust and become useless. The better way is to hand wash your knives and let them dry on a rack. You just wash the knife with dish soap and hot water. After you rise it with water and place it on a rack to air dry. It's really that simple, and you can help keep your knives in great condition.
