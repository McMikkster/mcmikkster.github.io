                    Look up any recipe online and you will always find oil as one of the ingredients. Oil is very versatile and can be used to fry food, as a dressing on salad, or even a dip for some bread.

                    When you are sauteing vegetables on a pan, you will always have to add oil. The oil creates a non-stick layer between the vegetables and the pan. There’s also better browning on the vegetables, making it tastier. We would not be getting these results if it were not for the oil.

                    One aspect of oil that you should know of is its smoking point. The smoking point of oil is basically the maximum temperature it can reach before it begins to fill the air with smoke. For example,if you’re trying to cook a steak on a stove, you would need an oil with a high smoking point like avocado oil.

                    Olive oil is considered by many the overall best and healthiest oil. There's different types of olive oil, ranging from extra virgin to refined olive oil. Extra virgin olive oil is best because it’s the least processed form of olive oil, meaning it retains all its natural antioxidants. Although it’s on the pricey side, I would recommend buying extra virgin olive oil. The smoking point for extra virgin olive oil is 350 F to 410 F so it can be used for deep frying.

                    Vegetable oil is a very vague and general term that refers to a type of cooking oil derived solely from plants. Most of us are familiar with this oil and have it laying around in our kitchen. There’s no harm in using vegetable oil, but you can benefit much more from olive oil. It’s great for cooking, frying, or making a dressing. It has a high smoking point that can reach around 450 F.
